# Markd
### A tiny markdown editor for your browser
Markd is a little experiment in local storage and (soon) Firebase. Whatever you write is saved locally to your browser so you can come back to it later. It's built with [Marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked), and small markdown parser from [@chjj](https://github.com/chjj).
